# Ravenous
React project created as part of Web Development Career Path on Codecademy. Focusing on React and API functionality.

1. Creating Static Components
2. Passing Information to Components
3. Setting the State of Ravenous Components
4. Interacting with the Yelp API

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:
- As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
- As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
- As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.
